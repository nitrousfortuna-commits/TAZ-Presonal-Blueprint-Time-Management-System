## V. Routine Optimization Principles
- **Focus on Depth:** 2 major creative sessions per day are enough if consistent.
- **Structure before Art:** Schedule, then design — not the reverse.
- **Document Everything:** Every learning and design insight → Notion Vault.
- **Reflect Weekly:** Don’t skip review; it’s the intelligence builder.
- **Energy, Not Just Time:** Work with your energy rhythm (strongest at night).

---

## VI. Next Step Blueprint
1. Build this full structure inside your Notion workspace.  
2. Link Google Calendar for alert automation.  
3. Use Notion Template for logging skills & reflections daily.  
4. Set monthly review checkpoint with creative milestone (poster, brand, or case study).  
5. Maintain 1-week energy balance system: **3 creative days + 2 learning days + 2 recovery days.**

---

✅ **Result Expectation:** Within 3–6 months — full creative discipline, Donato-level composition logic, visible progress on Behance / Instagram, and improved work-life balance.
